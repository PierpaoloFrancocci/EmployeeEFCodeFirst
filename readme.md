The project is the answer for the exercise requested by the company 
De La Rue plc

Create a simple Web Service that connects to a database back end and allows the following functions:

1.  Get a list of all employees in the database
2.	Retrieve a single employee based on Name
3.	Retrieve a single employee based on EmployeeCode
4.	Retrieve all employees that started after a certain date
5.	Add a new employee
6.	Delete an employee.

The database will use just one entity, namely Employee. It will have the following fields
1.	ID
2.	Name (String, up to 100 characters long)
3.	EmployeeCode (number)
4.	StartDate

Here are some things that we would like you to bear in mind.
1.	Use an ORM, preferably Entity Framework Code First
2.	Use Inversion of Control, preferably StructureMap
3.	Consider making it a multi-tier application
4.	Make the code as re-usable as possible
5.	Use patterns where possible, especially a generic repository for data retrieval
6.	Consider seeding the table
7.	Do whatever else you would normally do to make good, clean code for an enterprise solution.

This is a fairly complex task and we do not necessarily expect you to complete it in the time allowed. Please do as much as you can, to an appropriate level of completeness. 
Please use Git (locally)/GitHub for your version control with regular check-ins as you progress.


I have followed the suggestions of

to be able to complete the exercise

Many Thanks
